## What is a RESTful API?

- Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. As described in a dissertation by Roy Fielding, REST is an "architectural style" that basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web.

- RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.
